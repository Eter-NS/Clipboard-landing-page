## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Nothing technical. I wanted to train my planning on how to play with the design here and don't make so much bad decisions from the start.

### Continued development

I want to focus on how to do as less media queries as possible (as Kevin Powell said ðŸ˜Ž).
